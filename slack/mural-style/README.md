# MURAL Slack sidebar colours

Pretty colours used on MURAL's slack channel ðŸŒˆ

## How do I turn this on?

1. Go to workspace settings --> Sidebar, scroll to the bottom
2. Scroll to the bottom, click customize, and paste this onto the "copy and paste these values blah blah" textbox: `#4D4C4C,#cccccc,#ff0066,#FFFFFF,#000000,#ffffff,#ff0066,#ffcc00`
3. Enjoy!

## What am I getting?

Pretty much a sidebar that has a lot of MURALITY in it ;)
